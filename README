Apprentice is a low-contrast colorscheme based on the awesome Sorcerer by Jeet Sukumaran.

It is essentially a streamlined version of the original with a reduced number of colors entirely taken from the default xterm palette to ensure a similar look in 256 colors-ready terminal emulators and GUI Vim.
